# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.0.4] - 2025-02-06

### Changed

- Improved csv dialect detection
- Program generates addiotional out_*_ignored.csv, see Release Notes section
  below for detailed explanation

### Added

- run.bat script
- new entries to bank dictionaries

### Release Notes

Introduces run.bat script, which allows user to run the program without needing to
specify the filename. It gathers all the .csv files in project root directory,
whilst ignoring generated files, i.e. ones matching following patterns, where
<input_file> is non-generated input file name. Patterns are not regexes:
- out_<input_file>.csv
- out_<input_file>_ambiguous.csv
- out_<input_file>_ignored.csv
Added out_<input_file>_ignored.csv to generated files, which contains internal
operations or other operations that user decided to specify under Category.IGNORED.
Extended bank dictionaries with new categories, improving automation.

## [0.0.3] - 2024-02-03

### Changed

- Specialied bank processors classes (MillenniumProcessor, PekaoSaProcessor),
which will process data according to their implementation details. These classes
are injected into Bank instance by passing them as constructor arguments.
- Bank uses deep copy of data - preventing leaky abstraction.

### Added

- Docstring to multiple methods and classes.
- Exceptions module
- Category enum
- Commit hooks to the repository

### Release Notes

New classes have been added to this release, which provide cleaner and more
readable code in form of a layer of abstraction. \
Category enum is used across whole application which decreases changes for typos. \
Docstrings have been added to multiple classes and methods for sake of proper documentation.\
Bank uses deep copy of data - it prevents leaky abstraction. \
Commit hooks have been added to this repository. If you want to work on this repository,
please follow instruction in README.md file to first install pre-commit and then
intall commit hooks.

## [0.0.2] - 2024-02-03

### Release Notes

Release as version 0.0.3

## [0.0.1] - 2024-01-18

### Added

- Initial release.

### Release Notes

This release is able to process csv files from Pekao S.A. as of 18.01.2024.
There is a template for Millennium S.A. prepared but it is not working yet.

Please use this programm as you like. It was created to simplify data exporting
process from bank account to csv file in a very specific format which I personally
chose. Feel free to adjust this program to best fit your needs.
