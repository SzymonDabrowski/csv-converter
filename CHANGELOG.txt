## [0.0.3] - 2024-02-03

### Changed

- Specialied bank processors classes (MillenniumProcessor, PekaoSaProcessor),
which will process data according to their implementation details. These classes
are injected into Bank instance by passing them as constructor arguments.
- Bank uses deep copy of data - preventing leaky abstraction.

### Added

- Docstring to multiple methods and classes.
- Exceptions module
- Category enum

### Release Notes

New classes have been added to this release, which provide cleaner and more
readable code in form of a layer of abstraction. \
Category enum is used across whole application which decreases changes for typos. \
Docstrings have been added to multiple classes and methods for sake of proper documentation.\
Bank uses deep copy of data - it prevents leaky abstraction.

### Release Notes

This release is able to process csv files from Pekao S.A. as of 18.01.2024.
There is a template for Millennium S.A. prepared but it is not working yet.

Please use this programm as you like. It was created to simplify data exporting
process from bank account to csv file in a very specific format which I personally
chose. Feel free to adjust this program to best fit your needs.
